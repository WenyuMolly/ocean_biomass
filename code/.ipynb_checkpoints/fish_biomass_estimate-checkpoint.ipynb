We rely on the estimate by Proud  et al. assuming all of the acoustic backscatter originates from mesopelagic fish. We rely on the estimates in Table 3, which consideres 3 different scenarios for the fraction of mesopelagic fish harboring a gas-filled swimbladder, which is the main source for acoustic backscattering. We use the geometic mean of the three scenarios in Table 3 of Proud et al. as our best estimate for the biomass of mesopelagic fish based on acoustic sampling."
