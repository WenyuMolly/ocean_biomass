    "### Green algae\n",
    "In addition to green algae which are part of the picophytoplankton size group, there are also green algae which are larger. We could not find a good source to constrain the global biomass of green algae in larger size fractions. Therefore, we rely on several lines of evidence to provide a coarse estimate for the global biomass of green algae. A recent [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2016.120) quantified the contribution of chlorophyta (green algae) to the total phytoplankton community at all size fractions based on 18S rRNA metabarcoding. Sampling in diverse locations in the ocean, they find chlorophytes contribute about 10-20% of the total number of photosynthetic reads. Relying on 18S sequence abundance as a proxy for biomass is not a well-established practice, and has various biases. Thus, we also rely on an independent method for estimating the biomass contribution of chlorophytes to the total phytoplankton biomass. A recent [report](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.10452) has looked at the phytoplankton community composition in the deep chlorophyll maximum in the north east Atlantic Ocean based on FISH and flow-cytometry. The average contribution of chlorophyta to the total phytoplankton community reported in this study is ≈15%, which corresponds well with the 18S sequencing data. Thus, our best estimate for the global biomass of chlorophytes is 15% of the total biomass of phytoplankton.\n",

Flombaum et al. estimate a total of $≈3×10^{27}$ and $≈7×10^{26}$ cells for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. To convert cellular abundances into biomass, we need to rely on estimates for the carbon content of both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Data from [Buitenhuis et al.](https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/40778/), both from culture data as well as from indirect measurements in the field suggest the range of 16-92 fg C cell$^{-1}$ for Prochlorococcus and 82-600 fg C cell$^{-1}$ for Synechococcus. A recent [study](https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.10452) suggested that the carbon content of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus is dependent on the ambient illumination conditions, with cells have lower carbon content at higher illumination, and stabilize at ≈50 fg C cell-1 for Prochlorococcus and ≈100 fg C cell-1 for Synechococcus if cells experience above 1% of the surface photosynthetically active radiation. Based on their global distribution [Flombaum et al. 2013 (Fig. 1B)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1307701110), most Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are found in locations in which ambient light is above this threshold, and thus we use a value of ≈50 fg C cell$^{-1}$ for Prochlorococcus and ≈100 fg C cell$^{-1}$ for Synechococcus, which correspond to a global estimate of ≈0.2 Gt C.
