Macroalgae can be both benthic (attached to the seafloor), or planktonic (e.g. the common brown algae genus Sargassum). We first estimate the total biomass of benthic macroalgae, both green, red and brown. We note that holoplanktonic algae (algae which  spend their entire life cycle in open waters) are brown algae (which are protists), and thus we consider them when estimating the global biomass of marine protists.\n",
